# Documentation for the project - LaTeX. 

## The final report is titled report.pdf

#### To edit the tex files, install tex on your machine and run it locally. The download is time taking, but not hard. Here are the required instructions - 

On Ubuntu/Debian, type this into the terminal -

`sudo apt-get install texlive-full`

After that, you're practically good to go. Write whatever LaTeX file you want, save it as a .tex, and convert it to a pdf from the terminal - 

`texi2pdf name_of_input_file.tex`

This will generate a `name_of_input_file.pdf`, which you can view like a regular pdf.

Check the samples folder here for our FM Transmitter tex files, so you can get an idea of how things work.
